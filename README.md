# Smart Waste Management System: An IoT-Based Approach for Automated Waste Classification and Bin Monitoring

The scope of this project focused on the development and implementation of an AI-based waste classification system using the YOLOv5 model, as well as the integration of IoT sensors for bin monitoring. The AI system involved training the YOLOv5 model to 
accurately identify and categorize various types of waste, such as paper, cardboard, glass, 
metal, plastic, and trash. This system aimed to facilitate accurate and automated waste 
sorting, thereby enhancing recycling rates and reducing the incidence of improper waste 
disposal. In addition to the AI-based classification, IoT sensors were integrated into waste 
bins. These sensors collected real-time data on several parameters, including the level of 
fullness of the bins and the presence of methane and ammonia gases. This data was then 
transmitted through serial communication via USB to a desktop application. This desktop 
application, built on C# Windows Forms using the .NET framework, displayed the 
collected data. Furthermore, a mobile application was developed specifically for waste 
management personnel. This application enabled them to monitor bin readings from 
remote locations in real time and receive notifications when the bins reached 
predetermined thresholds for fullness, methane, and ammonia gas levels. Overall, the 
project was aimed at a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, waste 
management authorities, municipalities, policymakers, and organizations involved in 
waste collection and recycling. The ultimate goal was to improve waste management 
practices and promote environmental sustainability.
